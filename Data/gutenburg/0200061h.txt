Now when he reached the foot of the hill, he turned again towards the sea, and he saw his ship approaching the harbour, and upon her prow the mariners, the men of his own land. These things he said in words. But much in his heart remained unsaid. For he himself could not speak his deeper secret. All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life&rsquo;s heart. But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written. &ldquo;A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall bear me.&rdquo;
