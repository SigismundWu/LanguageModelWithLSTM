So for example, in a true ecotourism project, a nature reserve allows a small number of tourists to visit its rare animals and uses the money that is raised to continue with important conservation work.~~~1
The local people have jobs in the nature reserve as guides and wardens, but also have a voice in how the project develops.~~~1
Tourists stay in local houses with local people, not in specially built hotels.~~~1
In this way, they experience the local culture and do not take precious energy and water away from the local population.~~~1
They travel on foot, by boat, bicycle, or even elephant so that there is no pollution.~~~1
All of this creates a special experience that they will remember all of their lives.~~~1
This type of tourism can only involve small numbers of people, so it can be expensive.~~~1
But you can apply the principles of ecotourism wherever you go for your holiday.~~~1

It is often said that eyes can speak.~~~1
Have you ever had an experience like this?~~~1
On a bus, you may look at a stranger, but not for too long.~~~1
If he notices that he is being looked at, he may feel uncomfortable.~~~1
It is the same in daily life.~~~1
When you are looked at more than a few times, you will look yourself up and down in order to see if there is anything wrong with how you look.~~~1
If nothing seems wrong, you might feel angry with the person who is looking at you.~~~1
So eyes can speak, right?~~~1
Looking too long at someone may be impolite.~~~1
But sometimes things are different.~~~1
If you wish to draw someone's attention, you may look at him or her for more than a few seconds.~~~1

Schools usually want speakers to comment on world events, and the future that graduates can look forward to.~~~1
What do young people think about entertainment in our town?~~~1
We did a survey of our readers and this is what we learned.~~~1
All of the movie theaters are good, but Screen City is the best in town.~~~1
It has the biggest screens and the most comfortable seats.~~~1
However, Town Cinema is the cheapest, and it has the friendliest service.~~~1
The most popular clothing store is Jason's.~~~1
It has the best quality clothing, and it's also the cheapest.~~~1
Funky Fashion is the worst.~~~1
It has really bad service.~~~1
As for radio station, most people think that Jazz 107.~~~1
FM is really great.~~~1

It is generally accepted that television plays a big part in many people's lives.~~~1
But, there is still disagreement about whether television does more good or harm.~~~1
Television lets people know about current events, allowing them to follow developments in politics and science, and offers programs that are both educational and exciting.~~~1
Faraway countries, strange customs, and beautiful scenery can be brought right into your living room.~~~1
However, some people insist that television is bad rather than good.~~~1
They argue that it has brought about many serious problems.~~~1
The biggest one is its effects on young people.~~~1
Children are now so used to getting information and entertainment from television that it may reduce their ability to read and write.~~~1
More importantly, it keeps children inside, sitting down, stopping them from getting enough exercise.~~~1
People also blame TV for showing programs that encourage violence or bad behavior, and think this will affect children's minds.~~~1
In the end, television has both advantages and disadvantages.~~~1
Whatever effects it has, television in itself is neither good nor bad.~~~1
Everything depends on how we use it and what kind of programs we watch.~~~1
Everybody can suffer from stress.~~~1
No matter what your age is, you can feel stressed out by things that are happening in your life.~~~1
Teenagers, however, may find themselves in many more stressful situations than people in any other age group.~~~1
Being a teenager is hard.~~~1
You are not a child any more, but you are not an adult, even though you sometimes have to deal with some very grown-up problems and decisions.~~~1
Families can be one of the biggest causes of stress, and teenagers may have problems with parents arguing at home, or problems getting along with brothers and sisters.~~~1
Teenagers also have a lot of stress from school, either from their teachers or from their friends.~~~1
Some teenagers also feel stressed when deciding about their education after high school.~~~1
Getting a place at university can be very difficult and some students cannot afford to go to university.~~~1
Many teenagers also feel stress when they think about getting a job after they finish school.~~~1
There are so many young people finishing school, and not enough jobs for them.~~~1
Sadly, there is nothing we can do to remove these causes of stress from the lives of teenagers, but you can learn ways to deal with stress.~~~1
Talking to people about your problems is one of the best ways to deal with stress.~~~1
It may sound simple, but it is true.~~~1
A problem shared is a problem halved.~~~1

I began ballet classes when I was about five years old.~~~1
Since then, I have always loved to dance.~~~1
Dancing was my life when I was younger.~~~1
I learnt so quickly that the teacher would sometimes ask me to help her teach the other students.~~~1
The greatest part of being in ballet was taking part in the ballet shows.~~~1
That was when each of us could shine in front of our families and friends.~~~1
I always thought that the crowd was watching my every move and thinking, "Wow, that girl dances so beautifully." Just thinking about that made me try even harder to be the best I could.~~~1
The greatest part of being in ballet was taking part in the ballet shows.~~~1
That was when each of us could shine in front of our families and friends.~~~1
I practiced every day after school and right before bedtime, too.~~~1
It didn't even matter to me if there was no music playing.~~~1
I just kept on dancing.~~~1
Becoming a famous dancer was one of my greatest childhood dreams.~~~1
I believed that one day I would get the chance to be a dancer on a TV show, and now, that's what I do for a living.~~~1
Isn't that amazing?~~~1
For every little job we once had to do ourselves, there is now a machine to do it for us.~~~1
With all of the electrical appliances available for us to use now, I wonder how I would have lived fifty years ago.~~~1
For example, how would I have cleaned my floor?~~~1
Maybe we'll have a catastrophic electrical failure some day and find out just how much we really have been depending on our electrical appliances!~~~1
I'm not really sure why this is so,One day, a man was walking down the street when he came across a penguin.~~~1
It was a handsome bird, and not timid at all.~~~1
It seemed to take an immediate liking to the man, because it waddled up to him and then followed him wherever he went.~~~1
This was amusing for a while, but eventually became a little embarrassing.~~~1
The bored policeman looked up from what he was writing and said, "Just take it to the zoo, sir." "Oh, all right," the man said.~~~1

This was amusing for a while, but eventually became a little embarrassing.~~~1
The next day the man was walking along the street, still accompanied by the penguin, when he met the policeman he'd spoken to the day before.~~~1
The policeman was not pleased to see them. "I thought I advised you to take that animal to the zoo," he said.~~~1

Mr Brown had an umbrella shop in a small village.~~~1
People sometimes brought him broken umbrellas, and then he took them to a big shop in London.~~~1
They were mended there.~~~1
One day Mr Brown went to London by train.~~~1
He forgot to take an umbrella with him that day.~~~1
Sitting in front of him was a man with an umbrella standing beside the seat.~~~1
When the train arrived in London, Mr Brown picked up the umbrella as he often did during his journey by train.~~~1
Just as he was getting off, he was stopped by the man.~~~1
He said angrily.~~~1
Mr Brown's face turned red and he gave it back to the man at once.~~~1
When Mr Brown got to the big shop, the shopkeeper had got his six umbrellas ready.~~~1
After a good look at each of them, he said, "You've mended them very well." In the afternoon he got into the train again.~~~1
Mr Brown's face turned red and he gave it back to the man at once.~~~1

It is said that walking under the ladder means bad luck, and it's the same with black cats.~~~1
People say if a black cat crosses before you, it will bring you bad luck, too.~~~1
But I didn't think so until I heard my student Sam's story this afternoon.~~~1
This afternoon, Sam walked down the street thinking about when to hold a party for his girlfriend, so he didn't notice where he was going.~~~1
When he was walking right under a ladder standing against a building, a black cat ran out of a door, which surprised him and made him fall over.~~~1
His head hit the ladder.~~~1
The man who was cleaning the window at the top of the ladder fell down, and the dirty water went down through the air.~~~1
He got wet all over.~~~1
We are having dinner in the dining room.~~~1
Mary, the telephone is ringing, can you hear it?~~~1

We can't stop an earthquake, but we can do things to make sure they don't destroy whole cities. First it is not a good idea to build houses along lines where two of the earth's plates join together. Second, if you think there may be an earthquake, it is better to build houses on rocks, not on sand. Third you must make the houses as strongly as possible. Weak buildings will fall down in an earthquake, but strong ones may stay up. Scientists are afraid that one day an even bigger earthquake will hit the part around San Francisco. They call it "The big one". However, people today are still building more houses. The population in and around San Francisco is now ten times more than it was in 1906. This means that if there is another earthquake, a great many houses and buildings will be destroyed.~~~1

My little brother, Stan, is always putting things in his mouth and my mother has to watch him all the time. Recently my mother had to rush young Stan to hospital. He had been playing with a toy police car with a battery in it. We knew that he had swallowed it because we could hear the car going "BLEEP! BLEEP!" inside Stan's stomach. A surgeon operated at once and soon found the car, still bleeping! He also removed two marbles and a toy soldier. "Not a very healthy diet for a young man" the surgeon remarked. Mother didn't hear him. She was watching Stan, who had picked up the toy soldier and was putting it in his mouth! The surgeon saw this too. "Young Stan is going to be a sword-swallower one day," he said, grabbing the soldier just in time.~~~1

It is said that more than four million people die each year from smoking. That number is frightening. Yet people around the world continue to smoke. In the United States, about forty-seven million adults smoke. This year, more than 430,000 Americans died of diseases which have something to do with smoking. The American Cancer Societysays smoking harms the body greatly. It warns that smoking even a number of cigarettes is dangerous. It's not easy to give up smoking. However, doctors say you probably will live longer if you do stop smoking. You will feel better and look better. You also will protect the health of family members who breathe your smoke. "There is not one right way to stop smoking," doctors say. Any way can help. You can take long walks or spend time in places where smoking is not allowed. Also, you can eat a small piece of fruit or vegetables instead of having a cigarette. The sooner you stop smoking, the more you'll reduceyour chances of getting cancer and other diseases. Stop smoking before smoking stops you!~~~1

Mr Andrews had a young cat, and it was the cat's first winter. One evening it was outside when it began to snow heavily. Mr Andrews looked for it everywhere and shouted its name, but she didn't find it, so she telephoned the police and said, "I have lost a small black cat. Has anybody found one?" "No, madam," said the policeman at the other end, "But cats are really very strong animals. They sometimes live for days in the snow, and when it melts or somebody finds them, they are quite well." Mr Andrews felt happier when she heard this. And, she said, "Our cat is very clever." She almost talks. The policeman was getting tired, "well then," he said "Why don't you put your telephone down? Maybe she is trying to telephone you now."~~~1

My son Joe started dating a young lady whose father worked in a police station. Joe was interested in working there. And he came home one day and he said, "I'm taking the police test." When he graduated, they assignedhim to East New York where I started my career. However, Joe's brother, John wanted nothing to do with police or firefighters. He wanted to be the "next Donald Trump", a millionaire well-known inAmerica. But in 1984, I came down with throat cancer. He noticed how the guys I worked with in the fire department took care of us. He decided to be a firefighter. Both the boys would call us when they were working. John would always call around four o'clock, and that particular night, September 10, we spoke for a few minutes. And I said, "I love you." and he said, "I love you." Joe called me in the morning and told me to turn on the television, that a plane just hit the Trade Center. I just said, "Be careful. I love you." He said, "I love you, too." That was it. We had the boys for John for 36 years, Joe for 34 years. It's not many people that the last words they said to their son or daughter were "I love you," and the last words that they heard were "I love you." So that makes me sleep at night.~~~1

Two friends were walking through a desert. During the journey they had a quarrel, and one hit the other in the face. The one who got hit felt terrible because he was badly hurt, but he wrote in the sand, without saying anything, "Today my best friend hit me in the face." They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to have a swim. The one who had been hit got in trouble in the water and started sinking. His life was in danger but the friend saved him at once. After that, he wrote on a stone, "Today my best friend saved my life." The friend who had hit and saved him asked, "After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now you write on the stone. Why?" He replied. "When someone hurts us, we should write it down in the sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But when someone does something good for us, we must write it on the stone where wind can hardly erase it." Learn to write your hurts in the sand and to write your thanks on the stone.~~~1

Internet is educational.~~~1
Many people think children should be allowed to surf the Internet as they wish.~~~1
In this way, they can look through different subjects on different kinds of websites according to their own interest.~~~1
But in my opinion, children should always be watched while surfing the internet.~~~1
Many websites have information and pictures that children should not see.~~~1
There are many things that children don't understand.~~~1
All of these may have some bad influence on children's development.~~~1
Also, it is dangerous to let children use chat rooms by themselves.~~~1
Many parents tell their children not to talk to strangers on the street, so they should be careful of whom their children talk to on the internet, too.~~~1
What's more, sitting in the front of a computer for a long time isn't good for children's eyes, so parents should monitorthe time that children spend on the internet.~~~1
In a word, children should be kept away anything that could be bad for them.~~~1
I strongly believe that it is necessary for parents to watch their children when they use internetNew rules and behavior standardsin March.~~~1

April is Bird loving Month in China.~~~1

Maybe you'll find another earth in space in the future.~~~1

Has a thief ever taken money from one of your classmates?~~~1
Don't let it happen to you.~~~1
If you have to go back home late, you should let your parents know.~~~1
Use the Internet carefully.~~~1
The Internet can be very useful for your study.~~~1
But some things on the Internet aren't for kids, so try to look at the good web pages.~~~1
You can use the web pages for fun or homework.~~~1

With medical knowledge and skills today, two-thirds of the world's 42 million blind people should not have to suffer.~~~1
Its goal is to help fight blindness all over the world.~~~1

Your love can help them open their eyes to the world.~~~1

Many teenagers have hobbies. But sometimes these can get in the way of their schoolwork, and parents might worry about their success at school. Teenagers often think they should be allowed to practice their hobbies as much as they want. Do you agree? Liu Yu, a fifteen-year-old boy from Shandong, is a running star. He is on his school team and has always wanted to be a professional runner when he grows up. However, his parents won't allow him to train so much. "Of course we want to see him achieve his dreams," says Mr Liu. "And we know how much he loves running. My wife and I have supported every one of his races. We have nothing against running! But we think our son needs to think about other possible jobs. He's getting older now, so he needs to think about what will happen if he doesn't end up as a professional runner."~~~1

People often say that the Englishman's home is his castle. They mean that the home is very important and personal to him. Most people in Britain live in houses rather than flats, and many people own their homes. This means that they can make them individual; they can paint them, and change them in any way they like. Most houses have a garden, even if it is a very small one, and the garden is usually loved. People usually like to mark their space. Are you sitting now in your home or on a train? Have you marked the space around yourself as yours? If you are on the train you may put your coat or small bag on the seat beside you. If you share a flat you may have one corner or chair which is your own. Once I was travelling on a train to London, I was in a section for four people and there was a table between us. The man opposite to me had his briefcase on the table. There was no space on my side of the table at all. I was angry. Maybe he thought that he owned the whole table. I had read a book about non-verbal communication, so I took various papers out of my bag and put them on his briefcase! When I did this he stiffened and his eyes nearly poppedhis space! A few minutes later I took my papers off his case in order to read them. He immediately moved his case to his side of the table. Of course, it is possible that he just wanted to be helpful to me! If you are visiting another country you may feel that you don't have any private space. Hotel rooms look much the same in every country in the world. All day long, you share public spaces with other people. You see the local people in their private spaces and you feel lonely and "outside". Local people can create their private spaces by talking about things you don't know about. And you even feel that they like you to be outside them so that they will enjoy being inside even more! This is one of the difficulties of being a traveler! But if you understand it then it helps you. Haven't you enjoyed being part of a group and "owning" a bit of space?~~~1

Actually, on second thought, I don't think I want to go out tonightJiang Wen is at the top of the world of Chinese cinema. His Let the Bullets Fly has broken the box-office record for a Chinese film with some 700 million yuan. It is such a big success that wherever you go, you can hear people talking about Bullets. This time, he is not only the leading actor in the film, but also the director himself. Young people believe he was playing himself because to them, he is a true man, and expertsalso think highly of his way of telling stories. It seems that he does not need others to tell him how great he is. That does not mean he is not proud of Bullets. It's just that Bullets, for him, is fun. He has heard of all the political interpretationsof his story that have appeared across the Internet. The most wonderful scenes in his movies all seem to have something to do with reality, for example, in Bullets it opens with a train pulled by white horses. "I did not invent this set-up. For 30 years in the early 20th century, these was a part of rail line in Northeast China that was powered by horses," he explains. "You may come up with the most unlikely scenes, and you'll find that fact is stranger than fiction."~~~1

When I was a foreign teacher in China, every day I taught English to my students and they taught me about China. One day the topic turned to saying "I love you". I was shocked to learn that not one of my students had said this to their mothers, nor had their mothers said it to them. "Does your mom love you?" "Of course," they answered. "How do you know?" was my logical question. They responded that their moms cooked and always told them what they were doing wrong to show their caring. I was stunned. So mom's cooking and criticizing read out as "I love you". "Then how do you say 'I love you' to her?" They agreed that getting good grades, followed by good jobs would be how they showed their love. I come from a culture where most people are expressive enough, so I repeated these queries in classes over time. Gradually, I began to get different responses. Some of them had exchanged those sentiments with their moms. One of my favorite stories of change came from a girl. When she came home from university, her mother met her at the door and hugged her. This had never happened before, but her mom said, "Now that you have gone I have more time to myself. I noticed that in some places mothers and children hug each other and I decided it was a good idea and that I would begin hugging you." In my family we all say "I love you" a lot. While it is true that we often say the words without having great depth of feelings at that moment, it is almost like a blessing we give each other. Those three little words carry a world of meaning, even when said as a greeting, but most especially if they are the last words we say to or hear from those we love.~~~1
In all his years with the company, he never managed to meet the director.~~~1

Swimming is very popular in summer. People like swimming in summer because water makes people feel cool. If you like swimming and swim in a wrong place, it may not be safe. Last summer, more than ten people died when they were enjoying themselves in the water, and most of them were students. But some people are still not careful in swimming. They often think they swim so well that nothing can happen to them in water. Summer is here again. If you go swimming in summer, don't forget that better swimmers have died in water. They died only because they were not careful, not because they could not swim. So don't get into water when you go swimming yourself. Go with your teachers or your parents. If there is a "No swimming" sign, don't get into water, either. If you remember these, swimming will be safer.~~~1
