A good memory is a great help in learning a language. Everybody learns their mother tongue when they are a small child. They hear sounds, remember them and then learn to speak. Some children go abroad and live with their parents in foreign countries.
They can learn two languages easily because they hear, remember and speak two languages. At school, it is not so easy to learn a foreign language because students have only a little time to practice it, and they are busy with other subjects, too.

The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people plunged into the icy water. As there were not enough lifeboats for everybody, 1500 lives were lost.
But real tramps are not beggars.
They have nothing to sell and require nothing from others.
No matter how hard I tried, it was impossible to fill this beautiful pen with ink and to this day it has never written a single world!
A man who had broken his right leg was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas.
He was still mumbling something about hospitals at the end of the party when he slipped on a piece of ice and broke his left leg.
It took him four years to stage this elaborate joke simply to prove that critics do not always know what they are talking about.
When I was a boy, my grandfather told me how a German taxi driver, Franz Bussman, found a brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years before.
Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed.
In the 1970s, computers were common enough, but only in big business, government departments, and large organizations.
This was followed, at the end of the 1970s, by a machine called an Apple.
The IBM Personal Computer was widely copied.
Computers have become smaller and smaller, more and more powerful and cheaper and cheaper.
The quiet life of the country has never appealed to me.
You never have to travel miles to see your friends.
For them this is a major operation which involves considerable planning.
The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away.
Shopping, too, is always a pleasure.
Nor is the city without its moments of beauty.
There is something comforting about the warm glow shed by advertisements on cold wet winter nights.
When lights fuse, furniture gets rickety, pipes get clogged, or vacuum cleaners fail to operate, some woman assume that their husbands will somehow put things right.
I would not hear of the suggestion and said that I would fix it myself.
As far as I could see, it needed only a minor adjustment: a turn of a screw here, a little tightening up there, a drop of oil and it would be as good as new.
The mower firmly refused to mow, so I decided to dismantle it.
One of the links in the chain that drives the wheels had snapped.
I gave up in despair.
The weeks passed and the grass grew.
When my wife nagged me to do something about it, I told her that either I would have to buy a new mower or let the grass grow.
Needless to say our house is now surrounded by a jungle.
Buried somewhere in deep grass there is a rusting lawn mower which I have promised to repair one day.
We tell the river all our secrets.
We have special river birthday parties in the summer.
All the cattle had been moved into stalls and we stood to lose little.
We realized that they must have become unduly frightened by the rising flood, for their house, which had sound foundations, would have stood stoutly even if it had been almost submerged.
We still think it a miracle that they were able to do so.
Exploring really deep caves is not a task for the Sunday afternoon rambler.
The deepest known cave in the world is the Gouffre Berger near Grenoble.
The entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphine Alps.
They had to edge their way along this, sometimes wading across shallow streams, or swimming across deep pools.
Suddenly they came to a waterfall which dropped into an underground lake at the bottom of the cave.
To protect themselves from the icy water, they had to wear special rubber suits.
At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of rubble which had been washed up by the water.
Round about, piles of limestone glistened in all the colours of the rainbow.
I was only five when my father had taken me abroad, and that was eighteen years ago.
He always meant to go back on day, but not to stay.
It was not that I actually remembered anything at all.
I looked at the map and then at the millimeter.
I decided that I must have taken a wrong turning somewhere.
I landed up at the same corner.
The curious thing was that the lake was not marked on the map.
I left as if I had stumbled into a nightmare country, as you sometimes do in dreams.
And, as in a nightmare, there was nobody in sight to help me.
I waited till he came near, then I asked him the way to our old village.
He said that there was now no village.
This time he pointed to the lake.
The village no longer existed because it had been submerged, and all the valley too.
The bottle really does contain perfumed mud.
He loved to be told that one of his imaginary products was temporarily out of stock and he would faithfully promise to call again at some future date, but of course he never did.
The shop assistant looked puzzled and Harry repeated the word, slowly stressing each syllable.
This explanation evidently conveyed something to the women who searched shelf after shelf.
When Harry put on his act of being mildly annoyed, the assistant promised to order some for him.
Intoxicated by his success, Harry then asked for perfumed mud.
For once, Harry had to admit defeat.
He picked up what seemed to be the smallest bottle and discreetly asked the price.
From then on, Harry decided that this little game he had invented might prove to be expensive.
The curious bottle which now adorns the bookcase in his study was his first and last purchase of rare cosmetics.
Rubbish, however, is only part of the problem of polluting our planet.
The price we pay for cheap food may be already too high: Mad Cow Disease  in cattle, salmonella in chicken and eggs, and wisteria in dairy products.
The survey revealed a large number of sources of noise that we really dislike.
A lot of people object to mobile phones, especially when they are used in public places like restaurants or on public transport.
Loud conversations on mobile phones invade our thoughts or interrupt the pleasure of meeting friends for a quiet chat.
It turned out to be snoring!
If, however, you were holding an open air garden party or a fete it would be equally possible to insure yourself in the event of bad weather.
But the claim made by a local authority to recover the cost of salvaging a sunken pie dish must surely be unique.
The pie committee telephoned a local garage owner who arrived in a recovery truck to salvage the pie dish.
The dish rose to the surface and was gently drawn towards the canal bank.
The men were now obliged to try once more.
This time they fixed heavy metal clamps to both sides of the dish so that they could fasten the chains.
Several minutes later, the dish was successfully hauled above the surface of the water.
Water streamed in torrents over its sides with such force that it set up a huge wave in the canal.
By working at tremendous speed, the men managed to get the dish on to dry land before the wave returned.
People traveling long distances frequently have to decide whether they would prefer to go by land, sea, or air.
Hardly anyone can positively enjoy sitting in a train for more than a few hours.
At night, when you really wish to go to sleep, you rarely manage to do so.
Long car journeys are even less pleasant, for it is quite impossible even to read.
They also have the disadvantage of being an expensive form of transport.
You do not have to devise ways of taking your mind off the journey, for an airplane gets you to your destination rapidly.
The real escapist can watch a film and sip champagne on some services.
An airplane offers you an unusual and breathtaking view of the world.
You really see the shape of the land.
However you decide to spend your time, one thing is certain: you will arrive at your destination fresh and uncrumpled.
However, this freedom can easily be abused.
Stories about people often attract far more public attention than political events.
They would have continued to struggle against economic odds and would have lived in obscurity.
Television cameras and newspapers carried the news to everyone in the country.
Instead of being five new family members, these children had immediately become a commodity.
That still leaves the council with a problem. By 2013,only50%of 1995 levels of waste will benllewed to be sent to landfill. Even if recveling large are met, there will still be a large amount of rubbish to be burnt up. Due build an Edinburgh and Midlothian councils have now decided to work together to build an ineinerator plant as time to find a solution is fast running out.
The system has worked so well, that it has been adopted in other countries too.
The Ombudsman is not subject to political pressure.
As complaints must be made in writing, the Ombudsman receives an average of 1,200 letters a year.
He has eight lawyer assistants to help him and examines every single letter in detail.
The action he takes varies according to the nature of the complaint.
The Ombudsman immediately wrote to the Chief of Police in the district asking him to send a record of the case.
It was only possible for the Ombudsman to find this out by sending one of his representatives to check the facts.
Taking a path which led out of the town, we crossed a few fields until we came to a dense wood.
The place consisted of a straggling unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses.
Even under a clear blue sky, the village looked forbidding, as all the houses were built of grey mud bricks.
Sitting down on a dilapidated wooden fence near the field, we opened a couple of tins of sardines and had a picnic lunch.
Looking up I saw that we were surrounded by children in rags who were looking at us silently as we ate.
I concluded that they were simply shy of strangers.
Faces appeared at windows.
Men in shirt sleeves stood outside their houses and glared at us.
Old women in black shawls peered at us from doorways.
The most frightening thing of all was that not a sound could be heard.
We needed no further warning.
Turning back down the main street, we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting.
The old lady was glad to be back at the block of flats where she lived.
The chaos was inconceivable.
Then a police inspector arrived with a constable and she told them of her discovery of the ransacked flat.
The inspector then asked the old lady to try to check what was missing by the next day and advised her not to stay alone in the flat for a few nights.
He added that a student had dressed up as a policeman and was playing all sorts of silly jokes on people.
The workmen told him to do as he pleased and the policeman telephoned for help.
As the men refused to stop working, the police attempted to seize the pneumatic drill.
He threatened to call the police.
Only when he saw that the man was actually telephoning the police did he realize that they had all been the victims of a hoax.
Glancing at his map, he informed us that the next village was a mere twenty miles away.
He simply had no sense of danger at all.
But there was worse to come.
Just ahead of us there was a huge fissure.
Even this had no effect.
Bruce consulted the map once more and told us that the village was now only fifteen miles away.
Our next obstacle was a shallow pool of water about half a mile across.
A yellow light on the dashboard flashed angrily and Bruce cheerfully announced that there was no oil in the engine!
Indeed they can have a delightful surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned.
They leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards and attics for years, in the belief that they may one day need just those very things.
Things owned for a long time are full of associations with the past, perhaps with relatives who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth.
Some things are collected deliberately in the home in an attempt to avoid waste.
Collecting as a serious hobby is quite different and has many advantages.
One does not have to go outside for amusement, since the collection is housed at home.
There are also other benefits.
What is more they will not have to rely solely on the written word.
It is, in fact, a primitive type of calendar.
They had a definite meaning, for they were as near as early man could get to writing.
It seems that man was making a real effort to understand the seasons 20,000 years earlier than has been supposed.
It is a good thing my aunt Harriet died years ago.
Aunt Harriet lived in that leisurely age when servants were employed to do housework.
I often visited The Gables when I was boy.
Aunt Harriet presided over an invisible army of servants that continuously scrubbed, cleaned, and polished.
Bessie worked for Aunt Harriet for three years.
In addition to all her other qualifications, Bessie was an expert cook.
After being absent from The Gables for a week, my aunt unexpectedly returned one afternoon with a party of guests and instructed Bessie to prepare dinner.
She reluctantly came to the conclusion that Bessie was drunk.
Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself.
The daily exercises lasted only eleven minutes and I proposed to do them early in the morning before anyone had got up.
Little by little the eleven minutes fell to zero.
By January 10th, I was back to where I had started from.
I argued that if I spent less time exhausting myself at exercises in the morning, I would keep my mind fresh for reading when I got home from work.
We have been brought up to fear insects.
We regard them as unnecessary creatures that do more harm than good.
We live in dread not only of unpleasant insects like spiders or wasps, but of quite harmless ones like moths.
Most of our fears are unreasonable, but they are impossible to erase.
At the same time, however, insects are strangely fascinating.
We enjoy reading about them, especially when we find that, like the praying mantis, they lead perfectly horrible lives.
Last summer I spent days in the garden watching thousands of ants crawling up the trunk of my prize peach tree.
The tree has grown against a warm wall on a sheltered side of the house.
They were visited by a large colony of ants which obtained a sort of honey from them.
I bound the base of the tree with sticky tape, making it impossible for the ants to reach the aphids.
The tape was so sticky that they did not dare to cross it.
Instead, I saw that they had discovered a new route.
They were climbing up the wall of the house and then on to the leaves of the tree.
The ants had been quick to find an answer to my thoroughly unscientific methods!
Ships may be delayed by storms; flights may be cancelled because of bad weather, but trains must be on time.
But when the train dawdled at station after station, I began to wonder.
One hour and seventeen minutes passed and we had not even covered half the distance.
I asked a passenger if this was the Westhaven Express, but he had not even heard of it.
A tiny asterisk conducted me to a footnote at the bottom of the page.
The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life.
But how would we find such a planet?
Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets.
The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria.
In ordinary living, there can be some tolerance of unpunctuality.
He is therefore forgiven if late for a dinner party.
If no accidents occur on the way, like punctured tyres, diversions of traffic, sudden descent of fog, they will be on time.
The guest who arrives half an hour too soon is the greatest nuisance.
The only thing to do was ask them to come half an hour later than the other guests.
An even harder situation is to be on the platform in good time for a train and still to see it go off without you.

I discover what has happened in a crime and find the criminals involved.
I predict the weather using special technology.

Jim Green is a radio program host.
Jim Green gets up at 6:00 every morning.
He plays all the new pop songs and a lot of modern music for his listeners.
He reads the newspaper and listens to music after lunch.
He thinks his life is very interesting.
The most interesting part of the little town was the market, where there were a lot of cafes, restaurants and small shops full of all kinds of cheap goods. At this time of the year it was not crowded, as the tourist season had already come and gone. It was a lovely day with only a few little white clouds in the sky. It was not too hot, as it sometimes was during the summer, but pleasantly warm.
Two hours later, my friend phoned me from the house. At the moment, he said, he was listening to some of my records after having had a delicious meal. Now, he said, he was drinking a glass of orange juice. When I asked him if he had had any difficulty finding the house, he answered that the only problem was that he had not been able to find the key under the doormat, but luckily, the living room window by the apple tree had been left open and he had climbed in through the window. I listened to all this in great surprise.
Why should mankind explore space? Why should money, time and effort be spent exploring and researching something with so few apparent benefits? Why should resources be spent on space rather than on conditions and people on Earth?
Nearly every successful civilization has explored, because by doing so, any dangers in surrounding areas can be identified and prepared for. Without knowledge, we may be completely destroyed by the danger. With knowledge, we can lessen its effects.
While many resources are spent on what seems a small return, the exploration of space allows creative, brave and intelligent members of our species to focus on what may serve to save us. While space may hold many wonders and explanations of how the universe was formed or how it works, it also holds dangers. The danger exists, but knowledge can help human beings to survive. Without the ability to reach out across space, the chance to save ourselves might not exist.
While Earth is the only planet known to support life, surely the adaptive ability of humans would allow us to live on other planets. It is true that the lifestyle would be different, but human life and cultures have adapted in the past and surely could in the future.
In the animal kingdom, weaknesses can bring about aggression in other animals. This sometimes happens with humans, too. But I have found that my weakness actually brings out kindness in people. I see it every day, when people hold doors for me, pour cream into my cofffee for me, or help me to put on my coat.

 Which of the following is the most important skill to have if someone wants to get the job?
Windows are also useful while you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed before opening the window, otherwise smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Stay close to the window to make sure you are breathing fresh air, rather than smoke that may have leaked into the room. On the second or third floor, the best windows for escape are those which open onto a roof.
You can usually drop to the ground more safely from the roof. Dropping onto cement may end in injury. Bushes and trees can offer a softer landing.
 Which of the following should NOT be used when trying to escape from a fire?
Nice to meet you.

Unfortunately, the paintings have been exposed to the destructive action of water and temperature changes, which easily wear the images away. Because the Lascaux caves have many entrances, air movement has also damaged the images inside. Although they are not out in the open air, where natural light would have destroyed them long ago, many of the images have deteriorated and are barely recognizable. To prevent further damage, the site was closed to tourists in 1963, 23 years after it was discovered.

So, how can something so small be so smart? Well, here's how.
Nowadays, according to many people, life offers little excitement. They live and work in comparatively safe conditions; they buy food in shops; and there are doctors and hospitals to look after them if they become ill. The answer to some of these people is to look for danger in activities such as bungee jumping.
Finally, a person can apply what they learn from books to what they are doing in practice, making a meaningful experience more meaningful.
The bottom of the laptop was soaking wet and an empty, spilt water glass rested against the side of her purse just behind where the laptop was sitting.
The smartest, and often hardest, thing we can do in these kinds of situations is to be more reasonable in our reactions. We might want to scream or yell, but we must be wiser and more disciplined than that.
But if the lives of all the children had followed the pattern, the program would be far less interesting than it actually was. It was the children whose childhood did not prepare them for what was to come that made the program so inspiring. Where did their ideas come from about what they wanted to do when they grew up? Are children influenced by what their parents do, by what they see on television, or by what their teachers say? How great is the effect of a single important event? Many film directors, including Stephen Spielberg, say that an early visit to the cinema was the turning point in their lives. Dr. Margaret McAllister, who has done a lot of research in this area, thinks that the major influences are parents, friends, and interactions with society.
But they also take a lot of modern luxuries with them. Camping today is very different from the way people camped thousands of years ago.

Many Americans ask: Is our food healthy? Americans want to eat healthy foods. Sometimes, however, they eat badly. They want to eat fruit. They want to eat salads. However, sometimes they eat too much fast food! Fast food is not always healthy. It often has too much fat. There are not very many fruits or salads in fast food. Sometimes it is healthier to eat at home!
Who eats a lot of chocolate? Americans do! They drink chocolate milk. They love chocolate ice cream. They eat chocolate donuts at breakfast. Do Americans always eat chocolate? Of course not! I put plain milk on my cereal at breakfast. My father drinks a glass of milk without chocolate for breakfast. Americans also eat lots of different flavors of ice cream. My favorite ice cream is vanilla, not chocolate!

Last week, all the people at our library handed in a form with information about how often they read, and what they like to read. The answers we received were a surprise! We know that the people who visit our library love books, but it was wonderful to learn how often people read. Most people go to the library three times a week, and many people say that they can finish a book in two days. Most people said that they prefer to read at home, but they also want the library to be open all day so they can always come and find a new book. Some people even said that they feel unhappy when they see that the library is closed.

As of January 2015, there were over half a million people in the U.S. who were homeless. This means they sleep outside or in shelters. Many poor people are at risk of becoming homeless. This is because it is hard for them to afford a place to live. The hottest and coldest months of the year are most difficult for homeless people. They often wear shabby clothes that do not provide enough protection from the heat or cold. Sometimes, homeless people are forced to become beggars. They ask for money in order to buy food and other things they need. Fortunately, organizations like the Salvation Army help thousands of American homeless people each year. They provide food, shelter, education, and job training. Their programs also help the people who live there gain the important life skills necessary for a successful place in society.
Chinese food varies. Everyone around the world has heard of Chinese food and foreigners like it. There are different varieties of Chinese food, such as Cantonese style, Hunan style, et cetera. Cantonese style Chinese food is somewhat less filling, Sichuan style food is quite spicy, Shanghainese style food uses a lot of oil, and Hunan style food is also quite spicy but pungent too. Not everyone likes the same foods. In southern China, rice is served daily, and sometimes it is eaten at every meal. It accompanies fish, meat, and vegetables.

When I was in middle school, I had a pen pal from Estonia. The school provided the envelope, writing paper, and stamp, and I wrote the letter and addressed the envelope after licking the stamp. The teacher wrote the address of each of our pen pals on the chalkboard with chalk. Some of us put a picture of ourselves in the envelope, or if the size was small enough, we glued it to the bottom of the letter. I often wonder what happened to my pen pal and how his life changed after we stopped writing letters.
Julia Child was a famous American chef. She was trained at Le Cordon Bleu Institute in France. At the few women anywhere, let alone American women, attended the institute. The other students talked negatively about her, yet she remained at the school and became its star pupil. Child went on to publish a cookbook and star in her own cooking show, proving that ordinary American women could cook rich French food, just like she did so many years ago. She is certainly one of the most famous American chefs in history.
Once, there was a man named Carl who heard that South Africa had gold ore. He sold all his possessions and flew to South Africa. When Carl heard that a certain spot had a mine full of gold ore, he bought the land and began to mine. Carl did find some gold at first, but then the mine seemed to be empty. After a few months, Carl gave up, sold the land, and went home. The second owner discussed the situation with a surveyor. The surveyor told him to dig deeper. So, the second owner mined for gold until he was five feet deeper than Carl had gone. Yes, there was more gold ore and of Carl had just mined a little more, he would have found more gold.
People who want to save money need to go grocery shopping once a week. Studies show that families that buy groceries save more money than families that eat at restaurants. Shoppers can help themselves buy only what they need by making shopping lists. Fruit, vegetables, meat, bread, and other everyday foods can be bought on Monday, so no one has to worry about food for the rest of the week. Many fruits and vegetables cost more at restaurants. Meat is often two or three times the cost when someone else must cook it. So, if a family is struggling to have enough money to buy food, an easy solution is to avoid eating out, make shopping lists, and buy groceries in bulk.

Last Monday, my parents and I went for a walk in the woods. What I saw made me very sad. We counted eight old cars, and two old refrigerators. The litter baskets were empty and the grass was covered with cigarette ends, old tires, empty bottles, rusty cans, and pieces of paper.
